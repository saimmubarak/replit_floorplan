Goal (one line)
Add an Add Doors step to the wizard (after House Shape), a Delete/Erase tool, and a translucent Grass skin for plots. Doors are created only on house walls, attach to wall segments, are editable (move/resize), and render as a visual door skin plus a white door line that interrupts the wall stroke.

Wizard flow change

New step order: 1. Plot size → 2. House shape → 3. Add doors → 4. Details (walls, path) → 5. Export/Save.

Step 3 UI: show controls:

Door type: Single / Double

Width: numeric in feet (and optional quick-presets)

Button: Add Door (arms placement mode)

Add Door placement

After clicking Add Door, user clicks a wall segment to place a door. If user clicks off-wall, show tooltip: “Place doors only on walls — click a wall segment” and stay in place mode.

Door aligns to the clicked wall: center snaps to click, door axis perpendicular to wall.

Create two visible parts:

Door skin (architectural symbol scaled to width)

Door line (#ffffff) drawn over the wall stroke across the door width to visually interrupt the brick-red wall.

Multiple doors may be created by repeating Add Door.

Editing doors

Selecting a door shows handles. Handles allow:

Drag along the wall axis only (movement constrained to the wall).

Resize width via numeric input or drag handles (length along wall).

Doors may be dragged across corners and snap to adjacent wall segments or to another house’s wall if within snap threshold.

Doors must stay fully inside the chosen wall segment. If the specified width would extend beyond the segment:

Preferred: clamp center so door fits entirely inside.

Alternative: reject placement and show tooltip: “Door too wide for this wall segment — reduce width or choose another wall.”

Door rotation is automatic (always perpendicular to wall). Optional advanced toggle: “free rotate”.

Selection & interaction

Clicking the door selects it. Clicking wall selects wall. Provide predictable click precedence or a modifier for “select underlying”.

Door skin is non-interactive by default (click selects door object); provide optional toggle to edit skin separately.

Door creation, move, resize, delete are undoable/redoable.

Delete / Erase tool

Add a Delete/Erase tool button (mode). When active, clicking an object (house, door, roof skin, grass skin) deletes it. Prefer undo instead of confirmation.

Deleting a house cascades delete of its attached doors and skins (default behavior).

Keyboard shortcut: Del / Backspace removes selected item.

Grass plot skin

When a plot is created, add a translucent green fill (grass) that matches plot boundary.

Grass sits behind all other layers (houses, roofs, doors) and updates when the plot boundary edits.

Default opacity ~0.25 and a per-plot Show/Hide toggle.

Export must include grass under other layers.
